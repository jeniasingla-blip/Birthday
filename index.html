<h1>Happy 38th Birthday, Ram 🎂❤️</h1>

<p>
You’re 38 today… and somehow even more irresistible than last year 😌✨  
For starters, you now cancel plans with friends because you “have to wake up early for a walk.”  
Look at you… responsible, disciplined, slightly dramatic — and still unbelievably cute. 🚶‍♂️🌅
</p>

<p>
You say you want to spend your days doing the same things you always do…  
and somehow, those things are always connected to me.  
That part? I secretly love the most. 💋❤️  
Because in between your routines, your walks, your seriousness…  
there’s always us.
</p>

<p>
This year has been different.  
Deeper.  
Stronger.  
We didn’t just spend more time together —  
we built something real. Something intense. Something ours. 🔥💞  
The laughter, the chaos, the quiet nights, the stolen glances…  
we’ve been lovers in the most beautiful way.
</p>

<p>
And as you grow into every new version of yourself —  
the early-sleeping version, the focused version,  
the calm version, the slightly bossy version 😉 —  
I promise I’ll love each one of them.  
Softly. Fiercely. Completely.
</p>

<p>
You are not just another year older…  
you are another year wiser, stronger, and somehow even more magnetic.  
And I feel lucky — no, blessed — to stand beside you,  
to hold you, to tease you, to love you. 💖
</p>

<p>
Happy Birthday, my forever love, Ram. 🥂❤️  
Here’s to more walks, more cancelled plans,  
more stolen kisses,  
and a lifetime of us choosing each other again and again. ✨
