<h2>Happy Birthday Meri Pyari Bhughdi ❤️</h2>

<p>
My Ram… my Junju… my Appu… my Chico… my furball, my KitKat, my bhughdi, my curly-haired manboob with the softest heart and the most distracting smile 🤍✨

Today feels sacred. Slow. Golden. Like the universe woke up gently and decided to whisper your name a little softer than usual because it’s your birthday 🎂🌙. And I’m sitting here with a heart so full that it almost aches, wondering how I can possibly fit everything I feel for you into words. How do I write about a man who has become my safest place, my loudest laugh, my calm in chaos, my comfort in silence, my warmth on cold days, my favorite distraction, and my forever daydream all at once?

If birthdays are meant to celebrate existence, then today is not just about the day you were born. It’s about the day the universe quietly set in motion the possibility of us. The day my future favorite person took his first breath. Somewhere in that timeline, through all the randomness of life, through missed chances and perfect timings, we found each other. And that? That feels like destiny dressed in simplicity. ✨

Loving you is not always dramatic fireworks. It’s deeper than that. It’s softer than that. It’s instinct. It’s waking up and wondering if you slept well. It’s asking if you ate. It’s seeing dosa on a menu and automatically smiling because I know you’ll choose it over idli with that stubborn little nod 😌. It’s sipping filter kaapi and wishing you were across the table, teasing me about how strong I like it ☕. It’s scrolling through travel blogs and adding destinations to a mental list titled “With Him.” It’s me looking at bikes, gadgets, lamps, rugs, home decor, LinkedIn opportunities, and subconsciously building a future that always has you in it. 🏡🚲💼

You don’t just exist in my present. You exist in my plans. In my quiet hopes. In my loud dreams.

I imagine our mornings first. The kind where sunlight slips through the curtains and paints your face in gold. I wake up before you, just to watch you breathe for a second. Your hand searching for me even in sleep. Me pretending to move away just so you pull me back closer. You murmuring something half-asleep, voice deep and warm, and I melt every single time. 🥰

We’ll argue about breakfast. I’ll dramatically announce that I’m making dosa because “idli is overrated,” and you’ll roll your eyes but eat extra anyway. I’ll complain that you’re not helping, and you’ll come stand behind me in the kitchen, chin resting on my shoulder, hands sliding around my waist, stealing bites before they’re ready. Our kitchen will be messy sometimes, aesthetic on other days. Some nights we’ll experiment with recipes and burn everything, then end up ordering food at 11 pm and laughing on the floor while waiting for delivery. Because when it’s us, even chaos tastes sweet. 🍳❤️

And oh, my south mundu boi 🤍… I cannot tell you how clearly I see you on lazy Sundays. Crisp white mundu, hair slightly messy, trying to act dignified and serious while I’m internally combusting because how can one man be this effortlessly attractive? You’ll walk around like you own the house — and technically you will — but the second I come near you, that calm exterior will crack just enough for me to see that spark in your eyes. Old-school outside. A little sinful inside. The kind of man who respects tradition but also pulls me close in the kitchen when no one’s watching. The kind of man who will pray with me and then kiss me slow and deep like he’s been holding it in all day. 🔥🤍

When I think of our future, I don’t imagine only grand milestones. I imagine simple routines. Grocery shopping together. You pretending not to want dessert and then eating half of mine. Me obsessing over the “perfect” lamp while you patiently help fix it. You complaining about my online shopping tabs open for rugs and shoes, and yet secretly enjoying how excited I get over small aesthetic things. 🛍️🕯️

I see a little house. Not too big. Not too flashy. Warm lights. A balcony with plants I overwater. Wind chimes that sing in the evenings. A wooden dining table that becomes our office desk at night. Two laptops open. Deadlines looming. You stressed about a presentation. Me editing slides at midnight. Both of us dramatically texting each other “I’m quitting tomorrow” and then sending heart emojis five minutes later. Sharing workload. Sharing ambition. Sharing pressure. Sharing dreams. 💼🤝✨

We’ll build our careers side by side. Celebrate promotions with filter coffee and late-night drives. Sit under dim lights discussing strategies and future plans like a power couple who also steals kisses between spreadsheets. Our feet touching under the table while we work. Silent teamwork. That’s intimacy too. That’s partnership.

And then… the dream grows bigger. Two little munchkins. Two tiny humans with your eyes and your stubbornness. One with your curls that I’ll struggle to comb while you proudly say, “They got it from me.” The other copying your expressions, walking around like a tiny CEO of the house. I imagine you carrying one on your shoulder while the other holds your mundu and refuses to let go. I imagine hearing them call you “Appa” for the first time and watching you pretend you’re not emotional while your eyes give you away. 🥹👶

There will be a dog too. Obviously. A hyper little furball who thinks he owns the house. You’ll pretend you didn’t want him, but you’ll be the one sneaking him treats and talking to him like he understands everything. Our home will be loud. Full of toys on the floor. Milk spilled on the counter. Laughter echoing through hallways. Bedtime stories. Soft lullabies. And sometimes, after the kids are asleep, we’ll sit on the couch in comfortable silence, your arm around me, our dog at our feet, and I’ll think — this is it. This is everything. 🐶🏡

Junju… loving you is gentle, but it’s also electric. It’s the way your hand fits perfectly at my waist. The way your voice drops when you say my name slowly. The way your eyes darken when you look at me like I’m not just your girl but your favorite temptation. It’s playful. It’s teasing. It’s you whispering something in my ear that makes me blush in public. It’s you acting calm and composed while secretly being just as affected as I am.

You are my old-school romance wrapped in modern intensity. The kind of man who would write letters but also press me against the kitchen counter just to remind me I’m yours. The kind who will protect my peace fiercely but also laugh at my drama. The kind who makes me feel safe and wanted at the same time. That balance? It’s rare. And I cherish it more than I probably say out loud. 🔥

Do you remember the Horcrux thought? If someone once split his soul to survive, loving you feels like the opposite. It feels like all my scattered pieces gathered and became whole. But if I ever had to hide fragments of my soul, I wouldn’t put them in random objects. I’d hide them in our memories. In the first key to our home. In the hospital bracelet from when our babies are born. In your favorite coffee mug. In the collar of our dog. In the way your name feels when I whisper it at night. Each memory holding a piece of us. Each one making us unbreakable. 🖤✨

You are not just a chapter in my story. You feel like the storyline itself. The reason everything before you makes sense. The calm explanation for all my past confusion.

I imagine us years from now. A little older. A little wiser. Still teasing each other. Still flirting like we’re newly in love. Still arguing about silly things. Sitting on our balcony at sunset, sipping evening chai, talking about how we survived deadlines, tantrums, EMIs, sleepless nights… and still chose each other every single day. 🌅

And even when life gets heavy — because it will — I imagine us standing side by side. Facing problems together. Not as opponents, but as a team. Choosing patience over pride. Choosing understanding over ego. Choosing love over silence. That’s the kind of future I dream of. Not perfect. But real. Strong. Ours.

My Appu, on your birthday I don’t just wish you success. I wish you peace. I wish you mornings without anxiety and nights filled with restful sleep. I wish you confidence when doubt creeps in. I wish you courage to chase every dream you quietly carry. I wish you laughter that reaches your eyes and joy that feels steady. And selfishly… I wish to be there for all of it. 🤍

I want to celebrate your small wins and your big victories. I want to hold your hand when things feel uncertain. I want to be the place you return to after long days. I want to build a life where we are each other’s constant — not because we have to be, but because we choose to be.

Happy Birthday, my Ram. My Junju. My south mundu king. My curly chaos. My KitKat. 🎂✨

I love you in soft mornings and loud laughter.
I love you in kitchen chaos and corporate stress.
I love you in playful teasing and quiet comfort.
I love you in simple routines and ambitious dreams.
I love you in every tiny memory we’ve built and every one we’re yet to create.

And if loving you is magic… then I want to live inside that spell with you — building, dreaming, laughing, growing — every single day. 🤍✨
